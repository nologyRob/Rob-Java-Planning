    // So far in Java you have learnt about the following:
    // Primitive Data Types
    // Control Flow - if, else if, while, switch
    // Math methods
    // String methods
    // System.in (User input)
    // System.out (Console logging)


    // Your challenge is to use this new knowledge to create 'Dice Black Jack'
    // Dice Black Jack Rules
        // Two Players - Person vs Computer
            // Simple - Each player rolls the dice 5 times and the player with the highest score under or equal to 21 wins.
            // Simple - If the score of each player goes over 21, they are bust!

            // Advanced -   Each player can roll up to 5 times. They are presented their total score each time and have the decision to "hit" or "stay".
            // Advanced -   The winner of the game is the player with the highest sore under or equal to 21

    // We would like to see you use all Java learning to this point in today's challenge
    // All code must be completed in the MAIN class.  We will organise this once we have finished the challenge.
