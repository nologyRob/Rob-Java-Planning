public class MainMethod {

    // A main() method in java is an entry point to start the execution of a program. Every Java application has at least one class
    // and at least one main method. Normally, an application consists of many classes and only one of the class needs to have a main method.

    // All code is run through the main method!


    // The syntax for the main method is below
    // public static void main(String[] args) {

    // }

    // Hard to break down this too much at this stage because we don't know too much about methods in Java BUT

    // public - Available within the .com.company package
    // static - We don't need to call the class name before the package
    // void - This method doesn't need to return anything, void meaning nothing
    // main - Name of the moethod

    //(String[] args) = This is an array that is passed into main, for what it's worth, it's empty.  -- Don't worry too m uch about it
