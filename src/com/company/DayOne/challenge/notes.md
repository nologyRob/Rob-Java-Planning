# Challenge

So far in Java you have learnt about the following

- Primitive Data Types
- Control Flow - if, else if, while, switch
- System.in (User input/Scanner)
- System.out (Console logging)

Your challenge today is to create a Primitive Data Dictionary!

You must use system out to present all the primitive data types as options that a user can select to learn more about. 


    Please select one of the following data types to learn more about:

    1. int
    2. float
    3. long
    4. double

    Type the corresponding number of the data type that you would like to learn about"

The user may select 1.  This would match up with the data type int.  The terminal would then show the following information about the data type:

    Type, Range, Use Cases (What are the benefits of this type? Who would use them?)

Bonus - Add an option to quit the application.
